# Test page

{{ wip(104) }}

404 pages (usually described as a 'page not found') tell users that the page they were trying to access is not there.

{{ example("404-page.html", scaled=true) }}

## When to use a 404 page

There is a chance in all services that people will encounter a 404 page.
Processes and systems should be put in place to prevent users encountering 404 pages in the first place.

The main reasons you would need to show users a 404 page:

1. if they followed a link (URL) that is broken or pointing to the wrong location
3. if they typed or copied a link incorrectly

When you design the 404 page for your service you need to consider:

- the best way for people to solve the problem
- if there is anything spesific your service can do to help users

## How 404 pages work

When you design the 404 page for your service you need to consider:

- the best way for people to solve the problem
- if there is anything spesific your service can do to help users

The page should:
<!-- @todo add link to the page template -->
- use the standard page template
- include the phase banner relevent to the service
- have "Page not found" as the page title and H1
- be clear and concise
- an explination of the problem if possible
- not have breadcrumbs
- not use vague terms
- not use red text to warn people
- optionally display a form for users to tell us about the problem

## Research on 404 pages

We need more user research on 404 pages.

We want to know:

- if people are able to resolve the problem on their own
- if people understand what caused the page
- if people understand the content
- if anything is missing from the content
- if giving users a form to report the problem helps
